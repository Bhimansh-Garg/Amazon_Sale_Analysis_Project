# Amazon Sale Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover valuable insights about customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the data is cleaned, processed, and visualized. The findings are summarized in a professional PowerPoint presentation.  

**Goal:** Identify patterns that help optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and highlight business opportunities.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains Amazon sales records with the following attributes:

- **Order ID**: Unique identifier for each order  
- **Product**: Item purchased  
- **Category**: Product category  
- **Quantity Ordered**: Number of units sold  
- **Price**: Price per unit  
- **Order Date**: Date of purchase  
- **Region / City**: Geographical location of the order  
- **Order Status**: Delivered, Cancelled, Returned, etc.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, normalize columns, remove duplicates or outliers  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand sales distribution, trends, and patterns  
- **Identify Top Products & Categories**: Find best-selling items and categories  
- **Trend Analysis**: Study sales over time (monthly, seasonal, yearly)  
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Evaluate regional demand, cancellations, and returns  
- **Visualization**: Create meaningful graphs and charts to present insights  
- **Presentation**: Summarize key findings in a professional PowerPoint

## Technology Stack

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `pandas` : Data cleaning and manipulation  
  - `numpy` : Numerical computations  
  - `matplotlib` : Data visualization  
  - `seaborn` : Statistical and correlation plots  
- **Presentation Tool**: PowerPoint (`.pptx`)

## Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, and formatting issues  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Univariate and bivariate analysis; assess sales by category, region, and order status  
3. **Visualization**: Generate trend lines, bar plots for top products, heatmaps for correlations, and regional sales distribution  
4. **Results & Reporting**: Summarize key insights and dashboards in PowerPoint

## Expected Insights

- **Top-Selling Products & Categories**: Across regions and time periods  
- **Return & Cancellation Analysis**: Identify patterns and business impact  
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly, seasonal, and yearly performance  
- **Geographical Insights**: Regional preferences and demand patterns
