📊 Amazon Sale Analysis Project
📝 Overview

This project analyzes Amazon sales data to uncover insights about customer behavior, product performance, and overall sales trends. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we clean, process, and visualize the dataset, followed by a structured presentation of findings in the form of a PowerPoint report.

The goal is to extract meaningful patterns that can help optimize sales strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and highlight opportunities for business growth.
